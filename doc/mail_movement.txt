IDEAS:

- Support "[On ..., ]<Name> wrote:" header:
  - Adapt motions to accept this in place of the "From:" header.
  - Include in "aq" text object
- Add "ah" text object for the mail header block.

1.53	13-Jun-2011
FIX: Directly ring the bell to avoid problems when running under :silent!.

1.52	20-Dec-2010
Adapted to CountJump#Region#JumpToNextRegion() again returning jump position in
version 1.40.

1.51	20-Dec-2010
- ENH: ][ mapping in operator-pending and visual mode now also operates over /
  select the last line of the quote. This is what the user expects.
- Adapted to changed interface of CountJump.vim; now requires version 1.30.

ENH: Added support for MS Outlook-style quoting with email separator and mail
